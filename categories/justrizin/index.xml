      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://trizindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/bala-photo1.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone wp-image-358&#34; src=&#34;http://trizindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/bala-photo1.png&#34; alt=&#34;bala-photo1&#34; width=&#34;144&#34; height=&#34;160&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://trizindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Vladimir-Petrov.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone wp-image-353&#34; src=&#34;http://trizindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Vladimir-Petrov-300x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Vladimir-Petrov&#34; width=&#34;155&#34; height=&#34;155&#34; srcset=&#34;http://trizindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Vladimir-Petrov-300x300.jpg 300w, http://trizindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Vladimir-Petrov.jpg 370w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 155px) 100vw, 155px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vladimir Petrov (Profile here &amp;#8211; ) has been an avid supporter of TRIZ Innovation India and has always volunteered to spread awareness of TRIZ in India, which is the mission of TRIZ Innovation India. His simple reply to my email was &amp;#8220;How can I help TRIZ India?&amp;#8221;. I present excerpts from our online interview, which was the result of his offer of help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bala Ramadurai: From your track record, you have not only taught TRIZ, but also practically used it, as is obvious from your publications and patents. How did you get started with TRIZ?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vladimir Petrov&lt;/strong&gt;: I started studying TRIZ by correspondence with Altshuller in 1972. He led the two-year university program and I successfully completed the program. At the time, I was an R&amp;amp;D engineer. I immediately began to apply TRIZ in my work and also helped others solve their problems. In parallel, I passed TRIZ knowledge to my staff as well. In 1973, I started my teaching experience in TRIZ to my first group of 25 persons, a 120 hour program. That was my beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BR&lt;/strong&gt;: Please describe some of your memorable experiences with Altshuller. How was he as a teacher, friend?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VP&lt;/strong&gt;: About Altshuller, I have a lot of memories. This alone, I could write a great book. He was my teacher and colleague. We not only taught together at various occasions, we discussed various aspects of TRIZ as well. He became a friend of mine. When he came to Leningrad, he lived in my house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BR&lt;/strong&gt;: You have travelled across the globe teaching TRIZ. What according to you are some conditions that need to be there in place for TRIZ to be learnt and applied?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VP&lt;/strong&gt;: In my opinion, the most important thing is that people have to have a desire to learn TRIZ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BR&lt;/strong&gt;: Some people often question if TRIZ is meant only for engineers and technologists. What will be your response to such a question?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VP&lt;/strong&gt;: TRIZ methodology is universal and can be applied to any field of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BR&lt;/strong&gt;: Are there problems that TRIZ should not be used for solving? if so, which ones are those fields?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VP&lt;/strong&gt;: TRIZ cannot be applied effectively when one does not have enough knowledge or experience with a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BR&lt;/strong&gt;: Are there some problems that you solved or helped solve only to realize that the market for application of the solution had moved on and the solution was not relevant any more?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VP&lt;/strong&gt;: Even in this case, the specialist will solve problems faster and better than a non specialist only if they apply inventive thinking skills (TRIZ thinking).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BR&lt;/strong&gt;: Please tell us about your latest book. How will it benefit our readers on TRIZ India?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VP&lt;/strong&gt;: My latest book is written in Russian. It still needs to be translated into English. It&amp;#8217;s a big job and I&amp;#8217;m looking for helpers and sponsors. Maybe someone from your association can help me. This is a TRIZ tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BR&lt;/strong&gt;: Last question, what should practitioners from India do differently when applying TRIZ to solve problems?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VP&lt;/strong&gt;: Unfortunately, I do not know how and what you are doing [in India] now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Technology Forecasting – A Primer</title>
      <link>http://trizindia.org/2014/06/technology-forecasting-a-primer/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2014 09:44:01 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://trizindia.org/2014/06/technology-forecasting-a-primer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I promised a &lt;a href=&#34;http://trizindia.org/2014/02/the-history-of-triz/&#34; title=&#34;The history of TRIZ&#34;&gt;while ago&lt;/a&gt; that I&amp;#8217;d publish something about Technology Forecasting, which is my current occupation in Milan, Italy. I presented a talk on technology forecasting in Politecnico di Milano. I have attached the slideshow to this post. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ARIZ 85C algorithm application introduction</title>
      <link>http://trizindia.org/2014/04/ariz-85c-algorithm-application-introduction/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2014 02:26:40 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://trizindia.org/2014/04/ariz-85c-algorithm-application-introduction/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am a parent with 2 kids and I am finding it difficult to control the amount of non-school time they are spending on the internet and digital mobile games. This I am concerned with considering the effects of such engagement on the kids holistic development and well being (body, mind and social development). We (me and my friend Bala) are applying ARIZ 85 C core algorithm of TRIZ to find the right level of problem to attack and find not-so-obvious solutions, and subsequently identify system, and sub-systems to build.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**If you are interested in being part of this solutioning exercise as a parent or as a kid who is interested in designing better engagements with technology or as a practitioner of systematic innovation methods and applying some of the concepts or as a developer interested in building solutions, you are welcome. **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are 5 parts to the method set, which we will cover sequentially and share outputs of the methods here. Each of the method will have our inputs and application specific to the problem in hand. You may enter your responses/questions in comments.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Each post will have &amp;lt;&lt;Part 
Number&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&lt;Step Identifier&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&lt;Brief 
Title&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&lt;Type&gt;&amp;gt;. If you are already familiar with some
 of the methods or need an overall flow of methods, you may download the free ARIZ85C guide sheet.
**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 0 Step 0.1 Determine final goal of the solution and initial situation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a questionnaire Step 0.1: determine the final goal of the solution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*What is the technical goal (what characteristic of the object must be changed)? *Reduction in the number of hours of screen time for a child (5-12 years old)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*What characteristic of the object cannot be obviously changed in the process of solving a problem? *Parents do not have control over the content the kid watches. This cannot be changed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*Which expense will be reduced if the problem is solved?*Kids fatigue time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*What is the roughly acceptable expense?*10-20 hours of analysis time – Murali and Bala; 1 hour a day kids expense time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*What is the main technical / economical characteristic that must be improved? *Number of hours of screen time for a child (5-12 years old) / kids’ time available for social/creative engagements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially we are trying to avoid the blue ocean thinking, completely open strategy development in this step with clear identification of the technical goal, constraints, and if this effort is worthwhile considering the expenses and the improvement that may result. We also take care to identify metrics that are associated with each of them, from a system perspective. We are ok with emotional or unmeasurable things as long as it is clearly identified and is not ambiguous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next post to follow will be on **Part 0 Step 0.1 System Operator **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reference – NIMHANS -www.nimhans.ac.in/clinical-psychology/clinics-ncwb, has an center by name &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.co.in/search?q=SHUT+nimhns&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;amp;ei=9KK_WPHOOcSNvQSiraHgAg#q=SHUT+nimhans&amp;amp;tbs=sbd:1,qdr:y&amp;amp;tbm=nws&amp;amp;*&#34;&gt;Services for Healthy Use of Technology (SHUT) &lt;/a&gt; This center is set up to help mental conditions created due to overuse of technology at the renowned Bangalore based National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, sponsored by the Central Government.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Secret Sauce of Innovation</title>
      <link>http://trizindia.org/2014/04/the-secret-sauce-of-innovation/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2014 13:28:07 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://trizindia.org/2014/04/the-secret-sauce-of-innovation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  TRIZ (Russian acronym for Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) has been known for many decades. Innovation for mankind has been around since fire and wheel were invented and used successfully. Prior to TRIZ and its ally ARIZ (The Algorithm of Inventive Problem Solving), inventing was best left to people who were born with such a gift (or believed they were born with such a gift). With the advent and successful implementations of TRIZ/ARIZ to solve many challenging problems, one can confidently say that inventiveness can certainly be learnt. Our own experience in the field also points to the very same conclusion. The most common (FFAQ or frequently frequently asked question) is “I have managed just fine solving problems without TRIZ/ARIZ, why should I learn something like this?”. Our (and many others like us) answer is “Good question. If you are able to solve problems on your own, please go ahead and do that, since that is the best way to solve problems. If you can’t, TRIZ can help, write to us”.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  What in the world is TRIZ/ARIZ? You might ask. we have a 10 word, 15 symbol, 8 number answer &amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&#34;http://trizindia.org/2011/11/what-in-the-world-is-triz-part-1-2/&#34;&gt;http://trizindia.org/2011/11/what-in-the-world-is-triz-part-1-2/&lt;/a&gt;. Or better still, click the link given above.. 🙂 Please listen to &lt;a href=&#34;http://trizindia.org/2011/12/what-in-the-world-is-triz-part-2-2/&#34;&gt;http://trizindia.org/2011/12/what-in-the-world-is-triz-part-2-2/&lt;/a&gt; also.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  Once, you have applied the principles, solved many problems and you are ready to teach others how to solve these problems, there is always a problem coming your way &amp;#8211; “boy, o boy, which one of the umpteen techniques that I applied should I teach these guys to solve their problem”. Of course, you are tired of hearing the dreaded consultant “It depends” answer. Also, you don’t want to come across as a retired Colonel reciting his Victoria Cross stories to his bored lieutenants (Direct reference to Jungle Book’s Colonel Hathi). Both these options are tempting, but can have undesirable consequences on your participants. 🙂&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Shz7sL-9aq22BAbADT2k_5-3xpG0fOK0WWSKiCZMEyDHbij4wi4NfdbDUIXV9lOBEft6hKQi9F3bZoOZvl96BLYbLscDYfv2AGRhRg0MFhl6LJ6uoyG-yum-jPuesA&#34; width=&#34;450px;&#34; height=&#34;253px;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  (Image Source: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.animationsource.org/sites_content/jungle_book/upload/fanchars/pic_detail4de7df4ec4fac.png&#34;&gt;http://www.animationsource.org/sites_content/jungle_book/upload/fanchars/pic_detail4de7df4ec4fac.png&lt;/a&gt;)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  So what can you do now? Here is a secret sauce that has worked like magic for us.&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ppQkEUrcB3JpQQ8Okf8rTvNxfdKRfnSdYPF5kIHEg_5T1f7CiUMs_rIZtnuPeF8oLmpUIbMG60tM3rnAZITcL9g498MV7NSz3H18BMEh9Bqwc2LzL6O0-Hdh1cO85w&#34; width=&#34;532px;&#34; height=&#34;323px;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  First of all, let us give you some theory.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  In selecting TRIZ techniques for application, you are faced with 3 major dimensions (as given in the Figure, the only figure, we promise),
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  1.       The Person
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  2.       The Problem
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  3.       The Method
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  Person dimension includes the nature of participant or someone who will benefit by solving the problem or resolving a contradiction. Our experience indicates participants may belong to any of the below levels
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  ·         ‘Not for me’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  ·         ‘I Like this’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  ·         ‘I will apply as situation demands’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  ·         ‘this changed my way of thinking completely’
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  For TRIZ to become sustainable the more the number of people maturing to level 4, the better it is. So the first 3 levels have to be handled with care to make sure applications are easy and rigorous considering the next 2 dimensions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  Problem dimension includes how certain problems need special handling, with readymade tools from TRIZ portfolio.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  e.g.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  ·         For application around visualizing space-time, system operator (or 9 windows or 9 screens as it is fondly referred to) and an independent function analysis may well suffice
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  ·         For imagining the ideal future, Ideal Final Result and follow up with the Size Time Cost operator may be useful
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  ·         For resolving problems in tool/substance interactions, Substance-Field with standard solutions may be looked at
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  ·         For pure differentiation or following possible evolution paths of systems, the Trends of Engineering Systems Evolution will be handy
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  The final dimension of Methods is mentioned here because some methods lend itself for easy combination with others. e.g.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  ·         Immediately after doing functional analysis, time is right for trimming
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  ·         While you finish a Su-Field, looking for resources then, makes solutions cheaper and robust
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
  With rigor being built into the method itself, only practice and benefiting for current contexts constantly can make TRIZ part of your company&amp;#8217;s innovation culture.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am right now in Milan, Italy in close proximity to some of the people who have dedicated their careers to helping others solve problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of them is my friend and colleague, &lt;a title=&#34;Dmitry Kucharavy&#34; href=&#34;http://seecore.org/id4.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dmitry Kucharavy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simple question I asked him about 2 weeks ago was &amp;#8220;What is the history of TRIZ?&amp;#8221;.Dmitry replied, &amp;#8220;I am sending you a bunch of links, where I have attempted to answer the exact same question that everybody asks me on a routine basis.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the following is an excerpt of what Dmitry sent me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TRIZ: A Few Words about the History (1) (3:52)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TRIZ: A Few Words about the History (2) (4:45)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TRIZ: A Few Words about the History (3) (5:30)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slides used in the previous presentation are given below in this link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tetris-project.org/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=cat_view&amp;gid=61&amp;Itemid=55&amp;lang=en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tetris-project.org/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;amp;task=cat_view&amp;amp;gid=61&amp;amp;Itemid=55&amp;amp;lang=en&#34;&gt;http://www.tetris-project.org/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;amp;task=cat_view&amp;amp;gid=61&amp;amp;Itemid=55&amp;amp;lang=en&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW, you can also check out &lt;a title=&#34;Tetris Project&#34; href=&#34;http://www.tetris-project.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tetris-project.org&#34;&gt;http://www.tetris-project.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (A fun way to learn TRIZ. This project was headed by another colleague of mine, &lt;a href=&#34;it.linkedin.com/pub/gaetano-cascini/0/666/69&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Prof. Gaetano Cascini&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next post, I&amp;#8217;ll talk about the project that I am working on currently in Milan..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bala Ramadurai, Innovation Facilitator, MindTree&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shankar Venugopal, Innovation Leader, Honeywell, emerging markets&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Murali Loganathan, 4 years TRIZ practitioner, across industries in MindTree&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Podcast series in TRIZ tools&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the 1st podcast on Ideal Final Result&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Father of TRIZ &amp;#8211; Altshuller&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;value addition linked to Ideal Final Result (IFR)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is your experience with IFR?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shankar says &amp;#8211; Challenge &amp;#8211; mode of thinking into ideality &amp;#8211; common way of thinking is on constraints &amp;#8211; ideality is implementation free&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Murali says &amp;#8211; break psychological inertia (PI) &amp;#8211; PI comes in the way of ideation. Think backwards in time &amp;#8211; put constraints in the back. Vision and mission brings grandiose picture. Thinking backward in time, one cannot lie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bala quotes Murali &amp;#8211; cannot lie backward in time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freeland &amp;#8211; no harm, only benefits &amp;#8211; Wonderland with only benefits &amp;#8211; problem already solved. Psychologists have proved that lying is difficult backward in time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shankar &amp;#8211; SCAMPER &amp;#8211; M &amp;#8211; maximize/minimize&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 steps &amp;#8211; what should be maximized or minimized? zero cost &amp;#8211; barrier to thinking&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Murali &amp;#8211; Isak Burkhman &amp;#8211; nothing ideal or final about IFR. Free, perfect, now &amp;#8211; ideal definition for IFR. Use metaphors &amp;#8211; Wonderland is a better metaphor than IFR. Result = Process = goes forward in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heaven or Wonderland &amp;#8211; popular interface&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bala &amp;#8211; Example &amp;#8211; Altshuller &amp;#8211; coolant leakage &amp;#8211; usual way is trial and error. What if coolant is Cindrella? Cindrella shouts out &amp;#8220;Here I am&amp;#8221;. How do you make Cindrella is visible? Turn off the lights. Then solution &amp;#8211; Coolant needs to be colour emitting and says &amp;#8220;Hi, I am here&amp;#8221;. Ideal coolant or ideal way to leak? 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Murali &amp;#8211; Free transport &amp;#8211; A to B? marketing campaigns lets you go from A to B for a cause &amp;#8211; global warming, travelogue writing &amp;#8211; have fun for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shankar &amp;#8211; Why fly? find out the reason for flying. IFR + 5 whys gives a stronger solution. Fundamental problem identified and can arrive at solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bala &amp;#8211; CISCO cashed in on financial meltdown when corporates were slashing down prices &amp;#8211; different domain, different solution&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[youtube &lt;a href=&#34;http://youtube.com/w/?v=GU0w0B2LNEE&#34;&gt;http://youtube.com/w/?v=GU0w0B2LNEE&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternate use of IFR &amp;#8211; visioning. What should my team be doing in 2014, say? who are my customers? what is their IFR? work your way backwards and write down what your team should be doing now to meet that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Murali &amp;#8211; customer, customer&amp;#8217;s customer, supplier &amp;#8211; all of their IFRs are different. There could be conflicts or contradictions in each others&amp;#8217; IFR. How does one solve this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bala &amp;#8211; No compromise. AND is essential. customer wins AND Supplier wins. Inventive principles can help out here. First figure out IFR for all parties and solve the clash&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shankar adds &amp;#8211; clashes are going to be standard practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bala &amp;#8211; IFR + 9-windows can be combined. 9-windows spread in time and space. Mouse &amp;#8211; system, stuff around it &amp;#8211; phone, laptop, screen &amp;#8211; supersystem. Subsystem &amp;#8211; hardware wheel, software, components. All these things back in time and forward in time, what were they? You have 9-windows. System evolves from trackpad, mouse, touchscreen &amp;#8211; moves towards to an IFR. All systems/components move toward IFR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Murali comments on Worst Final Result (WFR) &amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heaven: IFR = Hell: WFR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You find out where systems can go wrong and fix it before things go drastically wrong&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shankar &amp;#8211; take a pen and design a non-working pen and reverse to get a good pen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Murali &amp;#8211; IFR in groups &amp;#8211; difficult to think of completely ideal future without accidents or lucky breaks (events). Publishing industry &amp;#8211; internet was an accident for publishing. IFR needs an accident or break. electricity and other fundamental innovations can change course of other innovation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shankar &amp;#8211; Accident can be looked at as an enabler. Author &amp;#8211; IFR &amp;#8211; should be able to write a book and reach the audience instantly. Reader &amp;#8211; read and access books instantly. Internet came in and enabled this. IFR can really help and accidents can be handled or enabled&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bala &amp;#8211; Luckily, internet happened. George Lucas, starwars, was way ahead of his time in terms of graphics. Graphics and sound effects in the &amp;#8217;70s sucked. He later remastered the Starwars series when technology was available&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shankar &amp;#8211; do IFR for everyday objects around yourself before jumping to applying to your tech problems. Make yourself at ease&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Murali &amp;#8211; Add &amp;#8220;Self&amp;#8221; as a prefix to make anything ideal. That is the way to get an IFR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bala &amp;#8211; take something that you care about and apply IFR for permanent change&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you next time on TRIZ podcast series from TRIZIndia.org&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear All TRIZ Masters and TRIZniks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the challenges for implementing TRIZ in India?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lack of patriotism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain drain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chaturvarnyam (Treating people on 4 categories a. Brahmins who perform rituals to please God, b. Warriors, c. Traders d. Workers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;abuse of drugs, cigarette, ganja, liquor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corruption &amp;#8211; an after effect of #4 above&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resistance to mindset change&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Believing that products from other countries are good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us debate on this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best Regards&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Structured Innovation Method for our Productivity Puzzle</title>
      <link>http://trizindia.org/2013/03/structured-innovation-method-for-our-productivity-puzzle/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 14 Mar 2013 18:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://trizindia.org/2013/03/structured-innovation-method-for-our-productivity-puzzle/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have been engaged in a java based development project where the development process is well defined and stream lined. We had already optimized the development process to a fairly optimal level and automated some key areas of development that gave us a good productivity boost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However the productivity levels achieved with all the process optimization and the automations we adopted were still not sufficient to meet the deadlines, we would be behind schedule by nearly a month if the same productivity was carried forward. The team believed that they have done all possible things and there is no further room for any optimizations and even if there is room it will still be only incremental. But our management team believed that we are not leveraging sufficient re-use opportunities and we must explore possibilities of re-use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to do a structured innovation exercise to find out if we come up with any ideas that will give us significant productivity improvement. We told ourselves that we are going do the exercise without any pre-conceived opinions and just follow the method&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the method that we followed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step-1:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started with everyone in the room sharing their Ideal Final Result (IFR) and eventually we narrowed down that the IFR that we wanted to achieve was to bring about 3 fold increase in development productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step-2:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went on deeper into the problem identification by process decomposition and finding out the development step that took the maximum amount of time, essentially we had an 8 step development process and identified the slowest step&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step-3:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we identified the specific problem area, we narrowed down the root cause of the problem by repeatedly asking why that problem is occurring or in other words ‘what is preventing’ us to solve the problem and we kept drilling it down until we could not go any further, and eventually came down to a specific step that was slowing down the integration time significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also we explored the broader problem that we are solving by asking ourselves ‘why do we want to solve’ and established the deadline goals for the project delivery&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The outcome:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the problem was narrowed down to the specific step that is the cause of the problem, the solution to solve it came out naturally from the team and it resulted in us introducing a specific additional process prior to initiating the development that would bring down the integration effort multifold. So eventually it turned out that the re-use was not really the cause of the core productivity issue but the delay in integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some inventive principles applied&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we defined the process step we continued further to explore opportunities for further improvement by applying the inventive principles and here are some principles we applied&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prior Action&lt;/strong&gt;: We introduced a process to be carried out prior to the development that will address the integration delay&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asymmetry&lt;/strong&gt;: Currently our development teams were equally divided to make progress into development, after the exercise we decided to form a team that is smaller than the development team to operationalize the ‘Prior Action’ that needs to be done so that it does not come into the critical path of the development cycle. There by we introduced asymmetry to the team distribution&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taking out&lt;/strong&gt;: Once we have done all the exercise we just glanced at our 8 step development process and asked ourselves can we ‘take out’ any of them and reduce the number of steps and it turned out that indeed we can take out a step and completely automate it, which will further save our overall development time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally&amp;#8230;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we all left the room with a sense of satisfaction that the 90 minutes that we spent on this exercise was worth it, as we truly believe that it will save days if not weeks worth of productivity gains&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cloud Computing: Analogy to Automotive</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Read about Cloud Computing and learnt that it is a solution which seperates the function of computing (Heavy Lifting job) and Display. This is like combining / integrating CPU of all the computers to form a Cloud and providing user with only User interface connected to Cloud through internet. This reduces the Cost as user will only pay for services (ex: 3D modelling) being used with hourly based rates. Second , size of devises is reduced as it&amp;#8217;s function is to only display information. Of course this is enabled by high speed internet emergent today. The solution essentially resolves Size vs Cost contradicition for computing industry.&lt;br /&gt;
An analogy to Automotive industry is to have a seperated power plant for all vehicles and power will be  electromagnetically or wirelessely tranferred to vehicles equipeed with transmission system. Electromagnetic power transmission is already a topic of state of the art research going on.  The industry has already taken first step to have electric power with it&amp;#8217;s own power plant (I.C. Engine) as in Hybrid vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although  an analogy, the extremes lies in designating solution in computing  as incremental  whereas for automotive a disruptive one!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear All TRIZINdian friends&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I too welcome the 500&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Member to this group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One suggestion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are recording the audio for publishing in the site, let the participant prepare the write up and read from it. Otherwise lot of extra noise (like yea.. ) arises and the user will not be able to grasp the content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best Regards&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joseph  &lt;/p&gt;
