This is an extract from seecore.org on ARIZ 71, that is described in the book, Innovation Algorithm by Genrich Altshuller. ARIZ can be used to solve problems. 
Some tips that I have learnt from experts in the field are:
 ARIZ is very methodical and systematic. Try to persist till you get the right solution ARIZ can sometimes be painstakingly long, so if you are unable to solve your problem through other means, by all means, try those.</description>

      <description>Hi All,
Here is the LINKED_IN discussion with multiple links highlighting evolution of TRIZ contradiction matrix. The ARIZ 85 C, Darrel mann&amp;#8217;s article on upgraded matrix and Sciencedirect paper on STEPS (Systematic Tool for Efficient Problem Solving) are worth reading articles. Hope this will help you to get latest updates.

      <description>A new arsenal to fight old enemies by Martin recently in The Hindu is one of the extreme examples of Resources (something that is available for free and has potential utility) that I have seen. I am reproducing the article below with emphasis on Resources, check it out. The frequency of resource occurring in our mind is possibly higher only if we pay attention deliberately.  {.detail-title}   A farmer in Nilampur puts to good use FM radio broadcasts against wild boar raids on her yam and tapioca farm    What do detergent cakes, abandoned compact discs, sardines, FM radio broadcasts and good old garlic have in common?</description>

      <description>What Engineers must need to know today ?     Reiterating the words from Management Guru Peter Ducker     &amp;#8221; Teach them what they don’t know today if you want to achieve phenomenal success tomorrow&amp;#8221;     With reference to image below and with respect to my observation, engineers today are doing brilliant job at providing engineering solutions and optimization studies. But there is hardly any drive for Innovation.</description>

      <description>We had given out a TRIZ India Workbook with enough space to doodle, brainstorm and use the specific guidelines on techniques used. While the appendix with the Business and Management Contradiction Matrix can be referred on Darrell Mann reference, available on amazon
We had also used TRIZ India Workshop Presentation , typical structure that we had for techniques is as follows
 the basic theory or other basis behind the technique a strong story where it was applied from either a personal experience or from other sources personal/individual application group application and facilitation notes  While we saw tremendous enthusiasm from industry (across IT, Oil and Gas, Energy, Pharma, Engineering in this workshop alone) we hope to get broader participation from academia as well.</description>

      <description>Re-post from http://trizit.blogspot.com 


Ok; this is for those who follow South Indian films and also know the &amp;#8220;super star&amp;#8221; in the Tamil movie industry, Rajinikanth. Do Google about him to know his super star power (in movies) and read some PJ&amp;#8217;s about him. But this is interesting, and not a joke, that his website www.allaboutrajni.com runs when there is no internet (a very simple solution technically)

      <description>Inline with TRIZ Principle, we can devise a simple rule to understand and appreciate any product or technology we come across. I mentioned about the rule and it&amp;#8217;s application for Automotive technologies at the link below.

Being in Pune I am just taking the case of local public bus transport however I am sure this applies to any general transport meant for public. The public road transport service (PMPML) in Pune although wide spread across the city is not the certainly the most profitable with it&amp;#8217;s fixed frequency schedule and a assumption that affordability of this transport is same for all commuters from all sections and classes.</description>

      <description>Look at your Problem through different lenses
The first step to come up with innovative ideas is to look at a problem innovatively i.e look at the problem through different lenses. We tend to look at a problem from only one angle &amp;#8211; but how to trigger our mind to look at it from different angles ? Try asking the question what would X do &amp;#8211; X could be Steve Jobs or Buddha or Don Quixote or Gandhi or your own Grandfather or Mother-in-law &amp;#8211; the idea is to bring a new perspective to the problem.</description>

      <description>Airline business makes its revenue and in turn profit per seat per mile flown. Naturally it is in their best interest to put more seats in the aircraft and the airline manufacturers have to oblige to see that its customers remain profitable. From 31 inch it may be reduced in future to 25 inch to accommodate more passengers. I recollect Principle 16 Partial or Excessive Action which reads “ If exactly the right amount of action is hard to achieve , use “ slightly less” or “slightly more” of the action, to reduce or eliminate the problem”.</description>

By removing the assumption that a front fork is necessary he forced himself to think of other ways to control the bicycle.[

      <description>We had Shankar visiting us at Bangalore last month. One of the activities that we did while he was here was without getting into any technique-terminology of TRIZ is it possible for some one to use TRIZ?
We took one sample problem from the IT industry context about a web site experience. While we were doing this I was actively applying TRIZ techniques without deliberately naming it. As a note of thanks to Shankar I created a visual representation of what we did that day.</description>

      <title>1 second billing: Telecom Trends</title>
      <link>https://trizindia.org/2009/10/1-second-billing-telecom-trends/</link>

      <guid>https://trizindia.org/2009/10/1-second-billing-telecom-trends/</guid>
      <description>Yesterday there was this announcement from TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) that it may go on to make per second billing mandatory across all operators.
Currently this feature is a market differentiator, that only TATA DOCOMO offers such a billing of call on a per second basis.
Why do we need to watch this trend, because if all operators adopt this there will be a revenue reduction of 10% in the sector.</description>

      <description>Those who own a pet, especially a dog will appreciate with what I am saying. It’s a demanding job to take your pet out for his routine every morning. He may be feeling relieved watering few electric poles but his “street” smart buddies do not take pleasure in his act &amp;amp; consider it an offense committed in their own terrain. They envy cozy life your pet enjoys and therefore start barking endlessly at him and indirectly at you; after all, you are the reason for his comfort.</description>

      <title>5*(5Ws and 1H)</title>
      <link>https://trizindia.org/2009/09/55ws-and-1h/</link>

      <guid>https://trizindia.org/2009/09/55ws-and-1h/</guid>
      <description>Before one gets into contradiction mapping, one needs to find out (5Ws and 1H)
 Who? Who was involved?
 What? What happened (what&amp;#8217;s the story)?
 When? When did it take place?
 Where? Where did it take place?
 Why? Why did it happen?
 How? How did it happen?
  Treating this like a mathematical equation
we have
Big picture=5W+1H
Toyota came up with the principle &amp;#8211; 5 Whys for problem definition and analysis.</description>
