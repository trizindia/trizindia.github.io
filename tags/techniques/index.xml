      <description>Set in the picturesque GE Bangalore campus had some interesting pick of speakers. Thanks to GE for being a great host.

Of course he hit the mark with India being a country of contradictions.
Sergei shared some interesting roi numbers and gave clear idea of Triz evolution.</description>
